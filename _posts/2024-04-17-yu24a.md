abstract: Applications such as the analysis of microbiome data have led to renewed
  interest in statistical methods for compositional data, i.e., data in the form of
  relative proportions. In particular, there is considerable interest in modelling
  interactions among such  proportions. To this end we propose a class of exponential
  family models that accommodate arbitrary patterns of pairwise interaction. Special
  cases include Dirichlet distributions as well as Aitchisonâ€™s additive logistic normal
  distributions. Generally, the distributions we consider have a density that features
  a difficult-to-compute normalizing constant. To circumvent this issue, we design
  effective estimation methods based on generalized versions of score matching.
