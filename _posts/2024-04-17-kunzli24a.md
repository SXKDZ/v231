abstract: Simulating fluid dynamics is crucial for the design and development process,
  ranging from simple valves to complex turbomachinery. Accurately solving the underlying
  physical equations is computationally expensive. Therefore, learning-based solvers
  that model interactions on meshes have gained interest due to their promising speed-ups.
  However, it is unknown to what extent these models truly understand the underlying
  physical principles and can generalize rather than interpolate. Generalization is
  a key requirement for a general-purpose fluid simulator, which should adapt to different
  topologies, resolutions, or thermodynamic ranges. We propose SURF, a benchmark designed
  to test the generalization of learned graph-based fluid simulators. SURF comprises
  individual datasets and provides specific performance and generalization metrics
  for evaluating and comparing different models. We empirically demonstrate the applicability
  of SURF by thoroughly investigating the two state-of-the-art graph-based models,
  yielding new insights into their generalization. SURF is available under https://github.com/s-kuenzli/surf-fluidsimulation.
