abstract: Graph Neural Network (GNN) research has highlighted a relationship between
  high homophily (i.e., the tendency of nodes of the same class to connect) and strong
  predictive performance in node classification. However, recent work has found the
  relationship to be more nuanced, demonstrating that simple GNNs can learn in certain
  heterophilous settings. To resolve these conflicting findings and align closer to
  real-world datasets, we go beyond the assumption of a global graph homophily level
  and study the performance of GNNs when the local homophily level of a node deviates
  from the global homophily level. Through theoretical and empirical analysis, we
  systematically demonstrate how shifts in local homophily can introduce performance
  degradation, leading to performance discrepancies across local homophily levels.
  We ground the practical implications of this work through granular analysis on five
  real-world datasets with varying global homophily levels, demonstrating that (a)
  GNNs can fail to generalize to test nodes that deviate from the global homophily
  of a graph, and (b) high local homophily does not necessarily confer high performance
  for a node. We further show that GNNs designed for globally heterophilous graphs
  can alleviate performance discrepancy by improving performance across local homophily
  levels, offering a new perspective on how these GNNs achieve stronger global performance.
