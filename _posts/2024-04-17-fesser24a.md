abstract: 'While Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have been successfully leveraged for
  learning on graph-structured data across domains, several potential pitfalls have
  been described recently. Those include the inability to accurately leverage information
  encoded in long-range connections (over-squashing), as well as difficulties distinguishing
  the learned representations of nearby nodes with growing network depth (over-smoothing).
  An effective way to characterize both effects is discrete curvature: Long-range
  connections that underlie over-squashing effects have low curvature, whereas edges
  that contribute to over-smoothing have high curvature. This observation has given
  rise to rewiring techniques, which add or remove edges to mitigate over-smoothing
  and over-squashing. Several rewiring approaches utilizing graph characteristics,
  such as curvature or the spectrum of the graph Laplacian, have been proposed. However,
  existing methods, especially those based on curvature, often require expensive subroutines
  and careful hyperparameter tuning, which limits their applicability to large-scale
  graphs. Here we propose a rewiring technique based on Augmented Forman-Ricci curvature
  (AFRC), a scalable curvature notation, which can be computed in linear time. We
  prove that AFRC effectively characterizes over-smoothing and over-squashing effects
  in message-passing GNNs. We complement our theoretical results with experiments,
  which demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves state-of-the-art performance
  while significantly reducing the computational cost in comparison with other methods.
  Utilizing fundamental properties of discrete curvature, we propose effective heuristics
  for hyperparameters in curvature-based rewiring, which avoids expensive hyperparameter
  searches, further improving the scalability of the proposed approach.'
