abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) and statistical relational learning are two
  different approaches to learning with graph data. The former can provide highly
  accurate models for specific tasks when sufficient training data is available, whereas
  the latter supports a wider range of reasoning types, and can incorporate manual
  specifications of interpretable domain knowledge. In this paper we present a method
  to embed GNNs in a statistical relational learning framework, such that the predictive
  model represented by the GNN becomes part of a full generative model.  This model
  then  supports a wide range of queries, including general conditional probability
  queries, and computing most probable configurations of unobserved node attributes
  or edges. In particular, we demonstrate how this latter type of queries can be used
  to obtain model-level explanations of a GNN in a flexible and interactive manner.
