abstract: 'Several graph analysis problems are based on some variant of subgraph isomorphism:
  Given two graphs, G and Q, does G contain a subgraph isomorphic to Q? As this problem
  is NP-complete, past work usually avoids addressing it explicitly. In this paper,
  we propose a method that localizes, i.e., finds the best-match position of, Q in
  G, by aligning their Laplacian spectra and enhance its stability via bagging strategies;
  we relegate the finding of an exact node correspondence from Q to G to a subsequent
  and separate graph alignment task. We demonstrate that our localization strategy
  outperforms a baseline based on the state-of-the-art method for graph alignment
  in terms of accuracy on real graphs and scales to hundreds of nodes as no other
  method does.'
