abstract: 'Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have become the de-facto standard tool for
  modeling relational data. However, while many real-world graphs are directed, the
  majority of today’s GNN models discard this information altogether by simply making
  the graph undirected. The reasons for this are historical: 1) many early variants
  of spectral GNNs explicitly required undirected graphs, and 2) the first benchmarks
  on homophilic graphs did not find significant gain from using direction. In this
  paper, we show that in heterophilic settings, treating the graph as directed increases
  the effective homophily of the graph, suggesting a potential gain from the correct
  use of directionality information. To this end, we introduce Directed Graph Neural
  Network (Dir-GNN), a novel general framework for deep learning on directed graphs.
  Dir-GNN can be used to extend any Message Passing Neural Network (MPNN) to account
  for edge directionality information by performing separate aggregations of the incoming
  and outgoing edges. We prove that Dir-GNN matches the expressivity of the Directed
  Weisfeiler-Lehman test, exceeding that of conventional MPNNs. In extensive experiments,
  we validate that while our framework leaves performance unchanged on homophilic
  datasets, it leads to large gains over base models such as GCN, GAT and GraphSage
  on heterophilic benchmarks, outperforming much more complex methods and achieving
  new state-of-the-art results. The code for the paper can be found at https://github.com/emalgorithm/directed-graph-neural-network.'
