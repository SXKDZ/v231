abstract: 'Neural Algorithmic Reasoning (NAR) is a research area focused on designing
  neural architectures that can reliably capture classical computation, usually by
  learning to execute algorithms. A typical approach is to rely on Graph Neural Network
  (GNN) architectures, which encode inputs in high-dimensional latent spaces that
  are repeatedly transformed during the execution of the algorithm. In this work we
  perform a detailed analysis of the structure of the latent space induced by the
  GNN when executing algorithms. We identify two possible failure modes: (i) loss
  of resolution, making it hard to distinguish similar values; (ii) inability to deal
  with values outside the range observed during training. We propose to solve the
  first issue by relying on a softmax aggregator, and propose to decay the latent
  space in order to deal with out-of-range values. We show that these changes lead
  to improvements on the majority of algorithms in the standard CLRS-30 benchmark
  when using the state-of-the-art Triplet-GMPNN processor.'
