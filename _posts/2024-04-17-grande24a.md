abstract: 'Persistent Homology is a widely used topological data analysis tool that
  creates a concise description of the topological properties of a point cloud based
  on a specified filtration. Most filtrations used for persistent homology depend
  (implicitly) on a chosen metric, which is typically agnostically chosen as the standard
  Euclidean metric on \textdollar \mathbb{R}\^{}n\textdollar . Recent work has tried
  to uncover the true metric on the point cloud using distance-to-measure functions,
  in order to obtain more meaningful persistent homology results. Here we propose
  an alternative look at this problem: we posit that information on the point cloud
  is lost when restricting persistent homology to a single (correct) distance function.
  Instead, we show how by varying the distance function on the underlying space and
  analysing the corresponding shifts in the persistence diagrams, we can extract additional
  topological and geometrical information. Finally, we numerically show that non-isotropic
  persistent homology can extract information on orientation, orientational variance,
  and scaling of randomly generated point clouds with good accuracy and conduct some
  experiments on real-world data.'
