abstract: Proteins are complex biomolecules that perform a variety of crucial functions
  within living organisms. Designing and generating novel proteins can pave the way
  for many future synthetic biology applications, including drug discovery. However,
  it remains a challenging computational task due to the large modeling space of protein
  structures. In this study, we propose a latent diffusion model that can reduce the
  complexity of protein modeling while flexibly capturing the distribution of natural
  protein structures in a condensed latent space. Specifically, we propose an equivariant
  protein autoencoder that embeds proteins into a latent space and then uses an equivariant
  diffusion model to learn the distribution of the latent protein representations.
  Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively generate novel
  protein backbone structures with high designability and efficiency. The code will
  be made publicly available at https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenProt/LatentDiff
