abstract: Fairness in graph neural networks has been actively studied recently. However,
  existing works often do not explicitly consider the role of message passing in introducing
  or amplifying the bias. In this paper, we first investigate the problem of bias
  amplification in message passing. We empirically and theoretically demonstrate that
  message passing could amplify the bias when the 1-hop neighbors from different demographic
  groups are unbalanced. Guided by such analyses, we propose BeMap, a fair message
  passing method, that leverages a balance-aware sampling strategy to balance the
  number of the 1-hop neighbors of each node among different demographic groups. Extensive
  experiments on node classification demonstrate the efficacy of BeMap in mitigating
  bias while maintaining classification accuracy.
