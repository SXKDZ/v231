abstract: Graph anomaly detection plays a vital role for identifying abnormal instances
  in complex networks. Despite advancements of methodology based on deep learning
  in recent years, existing benchmarking approaches exhibit limitations that hinder
  a comprehensive comparison. In this paper, we revisit datasets and approaches for
  unsupervised node-level graph anomaly detection tasks from three aspects. Firstly,
  we introduce outlier injection methods that create more diverse and graph-based
  anomalies in graph datasets. Secondly, we compare methods employing message passing
  against those without, uncovering the unexpected decline in performance associated
  with message passing. Thirdly, we explore the use of hyperbolic neural networks,
  specifying crucial architecture and loss design that contribute to enhanced performance.
  Through rigorous experiments and evaluations, our study sheds light on general strategies
  for improving node-level graph anomaly detection methods.
