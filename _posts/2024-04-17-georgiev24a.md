abstract: Solving NP-hard/complete combinatorial problems with neural networks is
  a challenging research area that aims to surpass classical approximate algorithms.
  The long-term objective is to outperform hand-designed heuristics for NP-hard/complete
  problems by learning to generate superior solutions solely from training data. Current
  neural-based methods for solving CO problems often overlook the inherent "algorithmic"
  nature of the problems. In contrast, heuristics designed for CO problems, e.g. TSP,
  frequently leverage well-established algorithms, such as those for finding the minimum
  spanning tree. In this paper, we propose leveraging recent advancements in neural
  algorithmic reasoning to improve the learning of CO problems. Specifically, we suggest
  pre-training our neural model on relevant algorithms before training it on CO instances.
  Our results demonstrate that, using this learning setup, we achieve superior performance
  compared to non-algorithmically informed deep learning models.
