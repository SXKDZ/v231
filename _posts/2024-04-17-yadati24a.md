abstract: The paper aims to explore the untapped potential of hypergraphs by leveraging
  attribute-rich and multi-layered structures. The primary objective is to develop
  an innovative learning framework, Hypergraph Learning Enriched with Attributes and
  Layers (HEAL), capable of effectively harnessing the complex relationships and information
  present in such data representations. Hypergraphs offer a more expressive and versatile
  way to model intricate relationships in real-world systems, accommodating entities
  with multiple interactions and diverse attributes. However, existing learning methods
  often overlook these unique features, especially cross-layer interactions, hindering
  their full potential.  The motivation behind this research is to bridge this gap
  by creating HEAL, a novel learning approach that capitalises on attribute-rich and
  multi-layered hypergraphs to achieve superior performance across various applications.
  HEAL adopts a feature smoothing strategy to propagate attributes over the hypergraph
  structure, enabling the decoupling of feature propagation and transformation steps.  This
  innovative methodology allows HEAL to capture the intricacies of multi-layer interactions
  while efficiently handling attribute-rich data.  Moreover, the paper presents a
  detailed analysis of HEALâ€™s design and performance, showcasing its effectiveness
  in handling complex real-world datasets. The implications of HEAL are far-reaching
  and promising. By unlocking the potential of learning on hypergraphs enriched with
  attributes and layers, our work opens up new possibilities in various domains.  This
  research contributes to the advancement of graph-based learning methods, paving
  the way for more sophisticated and efficient approaches in real-world applications.
