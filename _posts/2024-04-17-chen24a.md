abstract: Topological data analysis (TDA) is gaining prominence across a wide spectrum
  of machine learning  tasks that spans from manifold learning to graph classification.
  A pivotal technique within TDA is persistent homology (PH), which furnishes an exclusive
  topological imprint of data by tracing the evolution of latent structures as a scale
  parameter changes. Present PH tools are confined to analyzing data through a single
  filter parameter. However, many scenarios necessitate the consideration of multiple
  relevant parameters to attain finer insights into the data. We address this issue
  by introducing the Effective Multidimensional Persistence (EMP) framework. This
  framework empowers the exploration of data by simultaneously varying multiple scale
  parameters. The framework integrates descriptor functions into the analysis process,
  yielding a highly expressive data summary. It seamlessly integrates established
  single PH summaries into multidimensional counterparts like EMP Landscapes, Silhouettes,
  Images, and Surfaces. These summaries represent data’s multidimensional aspects
  as matrices and arrays, aligning effectively with diverse ML models. We provide
  theoretical guarantees and stability proofs for EMP summaries. We demonstrate EMP’s
  utility in graph classification tasks, showing its effectiveness. Results reveal
  EMP enhances various single PH descriptors, outperforming cutting-edge methods on
  multiple benchmark datasets.
