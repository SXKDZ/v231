abstract: 'Graph generation poses a significant challenge as it involves predicting
  a complete graph with multiple nodes and edges based on simply a given label. This
  task also carries fundamental importance to numerous real-world applications, including
  de-novo drug and molecular design. In recent years, several successful methods have
  emerged in the field of graph generation. However, these approaches suffer from
  two significant shortcomings: (1) the underlying Graph Neural Network (GNN) architectures
  used in these methods are often underexplored; and (2) these methods are often evaluated
  on only a limited number of metrics. To fill this gap, we investigate the expressiveness
  of GNNs under the context of the molecular graph generation task, by replacing the
  underlying GNNs of graph generative models with more expressive GNNs. Specifically,
  we analyse the performance of six GNNs in two different generative frameworks—autoregressive
  generation models, such as GCPN and GraphAF, and one-shot generation models, such
  as GraphEBM—on six different molecular generative objectives on the ZINC-250k dataset.
  Through our extensive experiments, we demonstrate that advanced GNNs can indeed
  improve the performance of GCPN, GraphAF, and GraphEBM on molecular generation tasks,
  but GNN expressiveness is not a necessary condition for a good GNN-based generative
  model. Moreover, we show that GCPN and GraphAF with advanced GNNs can achieve state-of-the-art
  results across 17 other non-GNN-based graph generative approaches, such as variational
  autoencoders and Bayesian optimisation models, on the proposed molecular generative
  objectives (DRD2, Median1, Median2), which are important metrics for de-novo molecular
  design.'
