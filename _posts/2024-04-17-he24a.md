abstract: Networks are ubiquitous in many real-world applications (e.g., social networks
  encoding trust/distrust relationships, correlation networks arising from time series
  data). While many networks are signed or directed, or both, there is a lack of unified
  software packages on graph neural networks (GNNs) specially designed for signed
  and directed networks. In this paper, we present PyTorch Geometric Signed Directed
  (PyGSD), a software package which fills this gap. Along the way, we evaluate the
  implemented methods with experiments with a view to providing insights into which
  method to choose for a given task. The deep learning framework consists of easy-to-use
  GNN models, synthetic and real-world data, as well as task-specific evaluation metrics
  and loss functions for signed and directed networks. As an extension library for
  PyG, our proposed software is maintained with open-source releases, detailed documentation,
  continuous integration, unit tests and code coverage checks. The GitHub repository
  of the library is https://github.com/SherylHYX/pytorch_geometric_signed_directed.
