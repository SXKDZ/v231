abstract: 'Many graph representation learning (GRL) problems are dynamic, with millions
  of edges added or removed per second. A fundamental workload in this setting is
  dynamic link prediction: using a history of graph updates to predict whether a given
  pair of vertices will become connected. Recent schemes for link predic- tion in
  such dynamic settings employ Transformers, modeling individual graph updates as
  single tokens. In this work, we propose HOT: a model that enhances this line of
  works by harnessing higher-order (HO) graph structures; specifically, k-hop neighbors
  and more general subgraphs containing a given pair of vertices. Harnessing such
  HO structures by encoding them into the attention matrix of the underlying Transformer
  results in higher accuracy of link prediction outcomes, but at the expense of increased
  memory pressure. To alleviate this, we resort to a recent class of schemes that
  impose hierarchy on the attention matrix, signifi- cantly reducing memory footprint.
  The final design offers a sweetspot between high accuracy and low memory utilization.
  HOT outperforms other dynamic GRL schemes, for example achieving 9%, 7%, and 15%
  higher accuracy than –respectively –DyGFormer, TGN, and GraphMixer, for the MOOC
  dataset. Our design can be seamlessly extended towards other dynamic GRL workloads.'
