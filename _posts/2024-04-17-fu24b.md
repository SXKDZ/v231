abstract: Physical simulations of fluids are crucial for understanding fluid dynamics
  across many applications, such as weather prediction and engineering design. While
  high-resolution numerical simulations can provide substantial accuracy in analysis,
  it also results in prohibitive computational costs. Conversely, lower-resolution
  simulations are computationally less expensive but compromise the accuracy and reliability
  of results. In this work, we propose a cascaded fluid reconstruction framework to
  combine large amounts of low-resolution and limited amounts of paired high-resolution
  direct simulations for accurate fluid analysis. Our method can improve the accuracy
  of simulations while preserving the efficiency of low-resolution simulations. Our
  framework involves a proposal network, pre-trained with small amounts of high-resolution
  labels, to reconstruct an initial high-resolution flow field. The field is then
  refined in the frequency domain to become more physically plausible using our proposed
  refinement network, known as ModeFormer, which is implemented as a complex-valued
  transformer, with physics-informed unsupervised training. Our experimental results
  demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in enhancing the overall performance
  of fluid flow reconstruction. The code will be made publicly available at https://github.com/divelab/AIRS/tree/main/OpenPDE/CFRF
