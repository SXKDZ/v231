abstract: 'Graph Clustering is required for the identification of communities and
  groups within a given network. In recent years, various attempts have been made
  to develop tools suitable for this purpose. Most recently, these attempts are based
  on the latest advancements in deep learning and especially in Graph Neural Networks
  (GNN). While some methods take into account the graph intrinsic topological structure
  throughout, surprisingly, the leading clustering methods ignore this during the
  final cluster assignment stage, which leads to sub-optimal results.   In this paper,
  we propose GSCAN: a Graph Stability Clustering for Applications with Noise, which
  is based both on node features and on the graph structure. We base our approach
  on the celebrated method of Exess-of-Mass (EoM), which is based the principle of
  maximizing cluster stability.  This method has additional desirable properties like
  resilience to outliers and the fact it doesn’t require an a-priory definition of
  the number of clusters. We extend EoM to work on the \ast intrinsic\ast  graph structure
  and propose two possible post-processes to deal with one of EoM’s shortcomings -
  its tendency to over-flagging data-points as outliers. These post processes harness
  the graph topology and lead to superior performance, even compared to leading clustering
  approaches that are trained end-to-end. We show that the proposed approach can be
  implemented in a fast and scalable manner. Our claims are backed on three well-known
  benchmark datasets.   Our code is available here: https://github.com/GraphEoM/GSCAN'
