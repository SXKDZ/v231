abstract: State-of-the-art neural algorithmic reasoners make use of message passing
  in graph neural networks (GNNs). But typical GNNs blur the distinction between the
  definition and invocation of the message function, forcing a node to send messages
  to its neighbours at every layer, synchronously. When applying GNNs to learn to
  execute dynamic programming algorithms, however, on most steps only a handful of
  the nodes would have meaningful updates to send. One, hence, runs the risk of inefficiencies
  by sending too much irrelevant data across the graph. But more importantly, many
  intermediate GNN steps have to learn the identity functions, which is a non-trivial
  learning problem. In this work, we explicitly separate the concepts of node state
  update and message function invocation. With this separation, we obtain a mathematical
  formulation that allows us to reason about asynchronous computation in both algorithms
  and neural networks. Our analysis yields several practical implementations of synchronous
  scalable GNN layers that are provably invariant under various forms of asynchrony.
