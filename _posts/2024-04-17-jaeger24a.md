abstract: We introduce a probabilistic latent variable  model for graphs that generalizes
  both the established graphon and stochastic block models. This naive histogram AHK
  model is simple and versatile, and we demonstrate its use for disparate tasks including
  complex predictive inference usually not supported by other approaches, and graph
  generation.  We analyze the tradeoffs entailed by the simplicity of the model, which
  imposes certain limitations on expressivity on the one hand, but on the other hand
  leads to robust generalization capabilities to graph sizes different from what was
  seen in the training data.
