abstract: 'This paper studies the relation between Graph Neural Networks and Distributed
  Computing Models to propose a new framework for Learning in Graphs. Current Graph
  Neural Networks (GNNs) are closely related to the synchronous model from distributed
  computing. Nodes operate in rounds and receive neighborhood information aggregated
  and at the same time. Our new framework, on the other hand, proposes GNNs with Asynchronous
  Communication: Every message is received individually and at potentially different
  times. We prove this framework must be at least as expressive as the existing synchronous
  framwork. We further analyze GwAC theoretically and practically with regard to several
  GNN problems: Expressiveness beyond 1-Weisfeiler Lehman (1WL), Underreaching, and
  Oversmoothing. GwAC shows promising improvements for all problems. We finish with
  a practical study on how to implement GwAC GNNs efficiently.'
