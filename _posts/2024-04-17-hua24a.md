abstract: Molecule generation is a very important practical problem, with uses in
  drug discovery and material design, and AI methods promise to provide useful solutions.
  However, existing methods for molecule generation focus either on 2D graph structure
  or on 3D geometric structure, which is not sufficient to represent a complete molecule
  as 2D graph captures mainly topology while 3D geometry captures mainly spatial atom
  arrangements. Combining these representations is essential to better represent a
  molecule. In this paper, we present a new model for generating a comprehensive representation
  of molecules, including atom features, 2D discrete molecule structures, and 3D continuous
  molecule coordinates, by combining discrete and continuous diffusion processes.
  The use of diffusion processes allows for capturing the probabilistic nature of
  molecular processes and exploring the effect of different factors on molecular structures.
  Additionally, we propose a novel graph transformer architecture to denoise the diffusion
  process. The transformer adheres to 3D roto-translation equivariance constraints,
  allowing it to learn invariant atom and edge representations while preserving the
  equivariance of atom coordinates. This transformer can be used to learn molecular
  representations robust to geometric transformations. We evaluate the performance
  of our model through experiments and comparisons with existing methods, showing
  its ability to generate more stable and valid molecules. Our model is a promising
  approach for designing stable and diverse molecules and can be applied to a wide
  range of tasks in molecular modeling. Our codes and models are available on \red{\url{https://github.com/WillHua127/mudiff}}
