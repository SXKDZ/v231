abstract: 'Existing multi-relational graph neural networks use one of two strategies
  for identifying informative relations: either they reduce this problem to low-level
  weight learning, or they rely on handcrafted chains of relational dependencies,
  called meta-paths. However, the former approach faces challenges in the presence
  of many relations (e.g., knowledge graphs), while the latter requires substantial
  domain expertise to identify relevant meta-paths. In this work we propose a novel
  approach to learn meta-paths and meta-path GNNs that are highly accurate based on
  a small number of informative meta-paths. Key element of our approach is a scoring
  function for measuring the potential informativeness of a relation in the incremental
  construction of the meta-path. Our experimental evaluation shows that the approach
  manages to correctly identify relevant meta-paths even with a large number of relations,
  and substantially outperforms existing multi-relational GNNs on synthetic and real-world
  experiments.'
