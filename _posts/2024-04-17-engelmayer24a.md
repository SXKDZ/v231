abstract: Neural algorithmic reasoners are parallel processors. Teaching them sequential
  algorithms contradicts this nature, rendering a significant share of their computations
  redundant. Parallel algorithms however may exploit their full computational power,
  therefore requiring fewer layers to be executed. This drastically reduces training
  times, as we observe when comparing parallel implementations of searching, sorting
  and finding strongly connected components to their sequential counterparts on the
  CLRS framework. Additionally, parallel versions achieve strongly superior predictive
  performance in most cases.
