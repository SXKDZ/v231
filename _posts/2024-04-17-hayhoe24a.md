abstract: Hypergraphs model higher-order interactions in complex systems, e.g., chemicals
  reacting only in the presence of an enzyme or rumors spreading across groups, and
  encompass both the notion of an undirected graph and a simplicial complex. Nonetheless,
  due to computational complexity, machine learning on hypergraph-structured data
  is notoriously challenging. In an effort to transfer hypergraph neural network models,
  addressing this challenge, we extend results on the transferability of Graph Neural
  Networks (GNNs) to design a convolutional architecture for processing signals supported
  on hypergraphs via GNNs, which we call Hypergraph Expansion Neural Networks (HENNs).
  Exploiting multiple spectrally-similar graph representations of hypergraphs, we
  establish bounds on the transferability error. Experimental results illustrate the
  importance of considering multiple graph representations in HENNs, and show promise
  of superior performance when transferability is required.
