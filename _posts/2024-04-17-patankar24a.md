abstract: 'Intrinsically motivated exploration has proven useful for reinforcement
  learning, even without additional extrinsic rewards. When the environment is naturally
  represented as a graph, how to guide exploration best remains an open question.
  In this work, we propose a novel approach for exploring graph-structured data motivated
  by two theories of human curiosity: the information gap theory and the compression
  progress theory. The theories view curiosity as an intrinsic motivation to optimize
  for topological features of subgraphs induced by nodes visited in the environment.
  We use these proposed features as rewards for graph neural-network-based reinforcement
  learning. On multiple classes of synthetically generated graphs, we find that trained
  agents generalize to longer exploratory walks and larger environments than are seen
  during training. Our method computes more efficiently than the greedy evaluation
  of the relevant topological properties. The proposed intrinsic motivations bear
  particular relevance for recommender systems. We demonstrate that next-node recommendations
  considering curiosity are more predictive of human choices than PageRank centrality
  in several real-world graph environments.'
