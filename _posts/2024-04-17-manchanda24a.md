abstract: Deep graph generative modeling has gained enormous attraction in recent
  years due to its impressive ability to directly learn the underlying hidden graph
  distribution. Despite their initial success, these techniques, like much of the
  existing deep generative methods, require a large number of training samples to
  learn a good model. Unfortunately, large number of training samples may not always
  be available in scenarios such as drug discovery for rare diseases. At the same
  time, recent advances in few-shot learning have opened door to applications where
  available training data is limited. In this work, we introduce the hitherto unexplored
  paradigm of  graph generative modeling under data scarcity. Towards this, we develop
  a meta-learning based framework for  labeled graph generative modeling under data
  scarcity. Our proposed model learns to transfer meta-knowledge from similar auxiliary
  graph datasets. Utilizing these prior experiences, our model quickly adapts to an
  unseen graph dataset through self-paced fine-tuning. Through extensive experiments
  on datasets from diverse domains having limited training samples, we establish that
  the proposed method generates graphs of superior fidelity compared to existing baselines.
