abstract: 'Obtaining sparse, interpretable representations of observable data is crucial
  in many machine learning and signal processing tasks. For data representing flows
  along the edges of a graph, an intuitively interpretable way to obtain such representations
  is to lift the graph structure to a simplicial complex: The eigenvectors of the
  associated Hodge-Laplacian, respectively the incidence matrices of the corresponding
  simplicial complex then induce a Hodge decomposition, which can be used to represent
  the observed data in terms of gradient, curl, and harmonic flows. In this paper,
  we generalize this approach to cellular complexes and introduce the flow representation
  learning problem, i.e., the problem of augmenting the observed graph by a set of
  cells, such that the eigenvectors of the associated Hodge Laplacian provide a sparse,
  interpretable representation of the observed edge flows on the graph. We show that
  this problem is NP-hard and introduce an efficient approximation algorithm for its
  solution. Experiments on real-world and synthetic data demonstrate that our algorithm
  outperforms state-of-the-art methods with respect to approximation error, while
  being computationally efficient.'
